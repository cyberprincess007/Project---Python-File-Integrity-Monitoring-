# Project---Python-File-Integrity-Monitoring-
I built a Python program that monitors files for changes and logs any modifications. It works by calculating a unique hash for each file, checking it at regular intervals, and recording the date and time whenever the hash changes. This helps detect unauthorized or unexpected file changes in real time.
